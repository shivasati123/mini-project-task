        <p>If you are lucky or connected you can get an ainvite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so i'm here to help you out.First plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:SET A BUDGET.If you are worrying about blowing your crash the whole time you won't have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times an priortize the designers you want to see most. Lastly purachase your ticket and get excited!.</p>

        <p>Always be tue to your own sense of style,if you don't you'll be uncomforatble the whole time and and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking it  waht the designers have chosen to express through their new lines.Also its's important to wear shoes you will be comfortable in all day . Obiviously you want to look good,but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
